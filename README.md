Presentation of SignalR with AspNet 5 (Vnext)

To resolve `Microsoft.AspNet.SignalR.Server 3.0.0-rc1-*`, you must add new feed in your package sources.
If you're using Visual Studio 2015, go to Tools > Options > Nuget Package Manager > Package Sources and add a new feed called whatever you like but with source set to `https://www.myget.org/F/aspnetmaster/api/v3/index.json`.
